#Even Even More Notes

#Python Tuples:
#used to store multiple iteams in a single variable
#ordered but unchanged
#we use rounded brackets

#create a tuple:
mytuple=("kiwi","pear","apple")
print(mytuple)

#get the type:
mytuple=("kiwi","pear","apple")
print(type(mytuple))

#get the lenght:
mytuple=("kiwi","pear","apple")
print(len(mytuple))

#allows duplicate values:
mytuple=("kiwi","pear","apple","kiwi","pear","apple")
print(mytuple)

mytuple=("kiwi","adfa",1234)
print(mytuple)

#tuple()constructor:
mytuple=tuple(("kiwi","pear","apple"))
print(mytuple)

#Even Even More Pratice
food=("cheeseburger","hotdag","fries")
print(food)

food=("cheeseburger","hotdag","fries")
print(type(food))

food=("cheeseburger","hotdag","fries")
print(len(food))

food=("cheeseburger","hotdag","fries","cheeseburger","hotdag","fries")
print(food)

food=tuple(("cheeseburger","hotdag","fries"))
print(food)

#Access items:

#negative indexing:
mytuple=("kiwi","pear","apple")
print(mytuple[-2:])
